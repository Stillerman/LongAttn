      "Squier to be so. The previous extract has given us his opinion; what\n",
      "follows supports it by his reasons. \"I have said that the Indians of\n",

      "of Carib stock. This opinion is founded not only upon the express\n",
      "statements of Herrara, who says that 'the Carib tongue was much spoken\n",
      "in Nicaragua,' but also upon their general appearance, habits and modes\n",
      "of life. Their language does not appear to have any direct relationship\n",
      "with that of the Southern Caribs, but is, probably, the same, or a\n",
      "dialect of the same with that spoken around what is now called Chiriqui\n",
      "Lagoon, near the Isthmus of Panama, and which was originally called\n",
      "Chiribiri or Chraibici, from which comes Gomera's Caribici, or Carib.\"\n",
      "In a note we learn that \"thirteen leagues from the Gulf of Nicoya,\n",

      "\n",
      "Of the Melchora we have no specimens. For each and every tribe, extant\n",
      "or extinct, of the Indians about the Chiriqui Lagoon we want them also.\n",
      "The known vocabularies, however, for the parts nearest that locality\n",
      "are other than Carib.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us, however, look further, and we shall find good reasons for\n",
      "believing that certain populations of the parts in question are\n",
      "called, by the Spaniards of their neighbourhood, Caribs, much in the\n",
      "same way that they, along with nine-tenths of the other aborigines\n",
      "of America, are called _Indians_ by us. \"The region of Chantales,\"\n",
      "writes Mr. Squier, \"was visited by my friend Mr. Julius Froebel, in the\n",
      "summer of this year (1851). He penetrated to the head-waters of the\n",
      "Rio Mico, Escondido, or Blue-fields, where he found the Indians to\n",
      "be agriculturalists, partially civilized, and generally speaking the\n",
      "Spanish language. They are called Caribs by their Spanish neighbours,\"\n",
      "&c. But their language, of which Mr. Froebel collected a vocabulary,\n",
      "published by Mr. Squier, is, like the rest, _other than Carib_.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may, then, safely be said, that the Carib character of the Moskito\n",
      "Indians, &c. wants confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Nicaragua._ A real addition to our knowledge is supplied by M. Squier\n",

      "between the Lake of Nicaragua and the Pacific, along with the occupants\n",
      "of the islands in the lake itself, being _Mexican_ rather than\n",
      "indigenous, he confirms. He may be said to prove it; since he brings\n",
      "specimens of the language (_Niquiran_, as he calls it), which is as\n",
      "truly Mexican as the language of Sydney or New York is English.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mexican character of the Nicaraguan language is a definite addition\n",

      "that one of the languages of the parts under notice is intrusive, and\n",
      "foreign to its present locality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining vocabularies represent four indigenous forms of speech;\n",
      "these (three of them of Mr. Squier's own earliest publication, and one\n",
      "known before) being--\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Chorotegan or Dirian of Squier--This was collected by the author\n",
      "from the Indians of Masaya, on the northern frontier of the Niquiran,\n",
      "Nicaraguan, Mexican or Astek area.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Nagrandan of Squier--This was collected by the author from\n",

      "Niquiran or Mexican area.\n",
      "\n",

      "district, Woolwa, of the tribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The Mosquito (or Waikna) of the coast.\n",
      "\n",

      "dealt with as a foreign tongue), what have we to say in the way of\n",
      "classification?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is safe to say that the Nagrandan, Dirian, and Woolwa, are more like\n",
      "each other than they are to the Mosca, Mosquito, or Waikna. And this\n",
      "is important, since, when Froebel collected the Woolwa vocabulary, he\n",
      "found a tradition of their having come originally from the shores of\n",
      "Lake Managua; this being a portion of the Dirian and Nagrandan area. If\n",
      "so; the classification would be,--\n",
      "\n",
      "_a._ Dirian, Nagrandan, and Chontal, or Woolwa (Wúlwa)\n",
      "\n",
      "_b._ Mosquito, or Waikna.\n",
      "\n",
      "The value of these two divisions is, of course, uncertain; and, in the\n",
      "present state of our knowledge, it would be premature to define it.\n",
      "Equally uncertain is the value of the subdivisions of the first class.\n",
      "All that can be said is, that out of four mutually unintelligible\n",
      "tongues, three seem rather more allied to each other than the fourth.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Respecting, however, the word _Astek_ (_Asteca_) itself, the present\n",

      "all, and that it was a word belonging to the _Maya_, and foreign to\n",
      "the Mexican, class of languages. It was as foreign to the latter as\n",
      "_Welsh_ is to the language of the British Principality; as _German_ or\n",

      "either one or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, it was a Maya word, in the way that _Welsh_ and\n",
      "_German_ are English, and in the way that _Allemand_ is a French one.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a word belonging to the country into which the Mexicans\n",

      "_Huasteca_ is the name of a language spoken in the parts about Tampico;\n",
      "a language separated in respect to its geographical position from the\n",
      "other branches of the Maya family, (for which Guatemala and Yucatan\n",
      "are the chief localities) but not separated (as is indicated in the\n",
      "_Mithridates_) from these same Maya tongues philologically. Hence\n",

      "\n",
      "The isolation of the _Huasteca_ branch of the Maya family indicates\n",

      "the Mexicans, called by themselves by some name hitherto undetermined,\n",
      "but by the older occupants of the country, _Astek_.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is believed, too, though this is more or less of an _obiter dictum_,\n",

      "did to that of the Goths and Lombards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whence came these invaders? The evidence of the _phonetic_ part of the\n",

      "to the populations of the Upper Oregon--populations like the Chinuk,\n",
      "the Salish, the Atna, &c. Here, for the first time, we meet with\n",

      "preponderance of the sound expressed by _tl_, reappears. For all the\n",
      "intermediate parts, with one or two exceptions, the character of the\n",

      "spoken so far N. as the Texian frontier, and separated from the other\n",
      "Maya tongues by dialects of the Totonaca and Mexican. This remarkable\n",
      "relationship was known to the writers of the Mithridates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In South America the language begins to be known when we reach the\n",

      "extends as far south as the frontier of Chili.\n",

      "\n",
      "So also are San Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica; in all of which\n",
      "there are native Indians, but native Indians who speak Spanish. Whether\n",

      "a few miscellaneous affinities; just enough to save it from absolute\n",
      "isolation. When we remember that the dialects with which it was\n",
      "conterminous are lost, this is not remarkable. Probably it represents\n",
      "a large class, _i. e._ that which comprised the languages of Central\n",
      "America _not_ allied to the Maya, and the languages of New Grenada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between the Moskito country and Quito there are only two vocabularies\n",
      "in the Mithridates, neither of which extends far beyond the numerals.\n",
      "One is that of the dialects of Veragua called Darien, and collected\n",
      "by Wafer; the other the numerals of the famous Muysca language of\n",
      "the plateau of Santa Fé de Bogota. With these exceptions, the whole\n",
      "philology of New Grenada is unknown, although the old missionaries\n",
